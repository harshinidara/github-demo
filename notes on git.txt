remote repository is considered as the fourth stage


snapshots is a record of our files that we look and the snapshot is the way that the git uses to keep the record of the files

parent commit is the reference of the commit that came previous to the parent commit
repositories or repo is the collection of all the files or the history of all the files and it stores all the commits and mainly used for storage
cloning is the process of copying the repo from the remote server ex. copying the filed from github
pulling is the process of downloading the commits that exists on the remote server
pushing is the process of adding files to remote server
branch is the active line of development and the most recent commit is the tip of the branch and the main branch is called as the master
octopus is the process of merging two branches
master is the default development branch and when we create a github we need to name the branch as the master
head is the reference to the most recent commits
index: whn a form is ready to put then it should be added in the index
gitadd is the comment used to add the files
gitcommit is the new commit used to create a new commit
evilmerge is the merge that introduces changes that should not appear in any parent
